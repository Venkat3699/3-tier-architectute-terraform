# Multi-tier-architecture-using-terraform

Deploy a scalable and resilient multi-tier architecture on AWS using Terraform.

# üìåWhat is Terraform?

Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool that lets you define both cloud and on-prem resources in human-readable configuration files that you can version, reuse, and share. You can then use a consistent workflow to provision and manage all of your infrastructure throughout its lifecycle.

# üöÄ Multi-Tier Architecture Overview

A multi-tier architecture typically consists of three layers: a presentation layer (web server), an application layer (app server), and a data layer (database server). Each layer serves a specific purpose and can be scaled independently, providing flexibility and efficiency.

**Web Tier**: This tier handles incoming user requests and can be horizontally scaled for increased capacity. It typically includes web servers and a load balancer for distributing traffic.

**Application Tier**: Application servers run our business logic and interact with the database tier. They can also be horizontally scaled to meet demand.

**Database Tier**: The database stores and manages our application data. In this architecture, we use Amazon RDS for a managed database service.

# üö¶ Getting Started

# Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

+ Terraform installed.
```
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y gnupg software-properties-common

    wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | \
    gpg --dearmor | \
    sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg > /dev/null

    echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] \
    https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | \
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list

    sudo apt update

    sudo apt-get install terraform -y
```

+ AWSCLI and IAM credentials configured.
```
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
sudo apt install unzip
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install -i /usr/local/aws-cli -b /usr/local/bin --update
aws configure
```

# ‚ú® Features

**High Availability**: The architecture is designed for fault tolerance and redundancy.

**Scalability**: Easily scale the web and application tiers to handle varying workloads.

**Security**: Security groups and network ACLs are configured to ensure a secure environment.

# üåü Web Tier

The Web Tier is the entry point for incoming user requests. It typically includes:

**Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic across multiple web servers.

**Auto Scaling**: Automatically adjusts the number of web servers based on traffic.

**Security Groups**: Controls incoming and outgoing traffic to the web servers.

# Web Tier Configuration
+ Launch Template Configuration
+ Load Balancer Configuration
+ Auto Scaling Configuration
+ Security Group Configuration of Load balancer
+ Security Group Configuration of Auto Scaling Group

# üöÄ Application Tier

The Application Tier hosts the application servers responsible for running business logic and interacting with the database tier. Key components include:

**Application Servers**: These run your application code and can be horizontally scaled.

**Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic to the application servers.

**Auto Scaling**: Automatically adjusts the number of web servers based on traffic.

**Security Groups**: Controls incoming and outgoing traffic to the application servers.

# Application Tier Configuration

+ Launch Template Configuration
+ Load Balancer Configuration
+ Auto Scaling Configuration
+ Security Group Configuration of Load balancer
+ Security Group Configuration of Auto Scaling Group
  
# üíΩ Database Tier

The Database Tier stores and manages our application data. We use Amazon RDS for a managed database service. Key components include:

+ Amazon RDS: A managed database service for MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQL Server databases.
+ Security Groups: Control incoming and outgoing traffic to the database.
  
# Database Tier Configuration

+ DB Subnet group Configuration
+ Amazon RDS Configuration
+ Security Group Configuration
  

# üîß Terraform Configuration

The Terraform configuration for this project is organized into different sections and resources to create the necessary AWS infrastructure components. Key resources include:

+ Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
+ Subnets, IGW, EIP, NAT and Route Tables
+ Security Groups and Network ACLs
+ Load Balancers
+ Auto Scaling Groups
+ RDS Database Instances
  
# üöÄ Deployment

Follow these steps to deploy the architecture:

1.Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Venkat3699/3-tier-architectute-terraform.git
```


2.Make changes as per your needs.

3.Initialize Terraform and apply the configuration:

```hcl
terraform init
terraform fmt
terraform validate
terraform plan
terraform apply
terraform destroy
```

4.Review the changes and confirm.

# üíº Usage

**Scaling**

To scale the Web or Application Tier, use Auto Scaling configurations provided in the respective Terraform files. Adjust the desired capacity to match your scaling requirements.

**Database Management**

Access the Amazon RDS instance in the Database Tier to manage your data.

**Load Balancing**

Configure the load balancer in the Web and Application Tiers to distribute traffic evenly.

**Security Considerations**

Review and customize the security groups and network ACLs to meet your specific security requirements.
